# Warren-Truss-Method-of-Joints-structural-analysis
Method of Joints calculations for a warren truss structure without using any non-graphical packages

The code has an issue with the horizontal member next to the pin support, however the rest of the calculations are trustworthy
This code was written to test different dimensions of a warren truss structure to test whether it would break under a load force. The results are not reliable enough to replace calculations by hand, but it is good enough to estimate the effects of different structure configurations such as support locations.

The code is written without using packages to understand the mathematics behind the method of joints in structural analysis
